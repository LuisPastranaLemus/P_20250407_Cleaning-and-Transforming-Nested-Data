# Data Analysis Project

This project is part of the second sprint in a data analysis challenge, focused on advanced data processing techniques. As a member of the analytics team, your task is to transform raw customer data from Store 1 into structured, usable formats for further insights.

## 📊 Project Description

Store 1 collects customer information in a nested list structure. Each sublist includes:

- `user_id`: Unique user identifier.
- `user_name`: A list with the user's first and last name.
- `user_age`: Age of the user.
- `fav_categories`: List of product categories the user shops in (e.g., `'electronics'`, `'sport'`, `'books'`).
- `total_spendings`: List of integers representing spending per category, matching the order of `fav_categories`.

This notebook performs the following tasks:

- Cleans and transforms the original data structure.
- Converts the nested lists into a pandas DataFrame.
- Conducts descriptive analysis on user behavior.
- Prepares the data for further modeling or segmentation stages.
